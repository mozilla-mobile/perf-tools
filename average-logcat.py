# This script will read logcat text from stdin, parse out duration values in the format
# specified below, and sum them. This is valuable to avoid having to do so by hand, an
# error prone operation.
#
# This script will parse out duration values values in the following format:
#     2020-05-04 15:15:50.340 10845-10845/? E/lol: average 37
# In particular, the logcat message must be 'average <duration>'; the reminder of the
# log or log tag does not matter. All other lines will be ignored.
#
# Example usage:
# $ cat logcat-output.txt | ./average-logcat.py
#
# Sample output:
# 10 runs, average: 36.7
# [41, 40, 38, 37, 40, 37, 37, 37, 30, 30]
